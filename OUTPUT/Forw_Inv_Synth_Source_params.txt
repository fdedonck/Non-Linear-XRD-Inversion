Run Parameters for Forw_Inv_Synth_Source
========================================

# Flags and Settings
Number of most relevant minerals to keep (if None: keep all)     :    None
Prior erosion rates     :    Total erosion uniformally distributed
Starting point of non linear iteration     :    Specified in the "Uniform Prior?" section
Nonlinear inversion     :    Quasi Newton solution - preconditioning with Hessian
